# weather_app

A new Flutter application to know weather.

## About App

It's my go at designing beautiful UI's for Cross Platform using Flutter.
The app requires user location data in order to receive Weather location of the area.
So make sure you turn on your GPS in order for application to work.

The app has a dynamic background which changes itself based on current weather conditions.
The local time of the area and the temperature.
All the design elements are minimal and UI is easy to use.
User can also search weather of an area by simply typing the Region they want the location for.
That page can be found by tapping the city icon on the top right corner.
